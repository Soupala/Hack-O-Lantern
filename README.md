Hack O' Lantern
==============

This idea started as a holiday workshop.  We did some basic fun stuff with the kids, but I wanted to learn how to incorporate an Arduino Nano into the project, hook up a PIR sensor, and trigger LED lights, sound, etc.

--------------

**Notes**

- Datasheet for the PIR sensor is included.
- A draft schematic of our circuit is included, but please note that originally pin9 was being used for a bright LED, but I decided to swap it out and play with sound.
- This is not necessarily a stable setup.  I'm playing around and learning as I go.  You've been warned :)
